# Time Capsules from the 90s

> The old web recreated with modern technology

This project was created during the weekend of September 10-12 for the [Prehistoric Hackathon](https://prehackstoric.devpost.com/)

## About

This is a project which lets you provide it with images, heading and paragraphs of text, and then combines all of them to form a website which mimics the look of the web from the 90s and early 2000s

There are multiple prebuilt themes which are choosen at random. Don't like what you see? Refresh the page until you get something which you like
